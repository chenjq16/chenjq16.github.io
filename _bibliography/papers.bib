	abstract = {Pedestrian navigation methods based on inertial sensors are commonly used to solve navigation and positioning problems when satellite signals are unavailable. To address the issue of heading angle errors accumulating over time in pedestrian navigation systems that rely solely on the Zero Velocity Update (ZUPT) algorithm, it is feasible to use the pedestrianâ€™s motion constraints to constrain the errors. Firstly, a human step length model is built using human kinematic data collected by the motion capture system. Secondly, we propose the bipedal constraint algorithm based on the established human step length model. Real field experiments demonstrate that, by introducing the bipedal constraint algorithm, the mean biped radial errors of the experiments are reduced by 68.16\% and 50.61\%, respectively. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm effectively reduces the radial error of the navigation results and improves the accuracy of the navigation.},

	abstract = {Gyro north finders have been widely used in weapons aiming, military vehicles, mining, tunneling and other military and commercial applications. In this paper, a MEMS gyro north finder based on rotation modulation technique is proposed. The developed north finder has advantages of small size, light weight, low cost, low power consumption and good accuracy. The two-phase axial flux permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) is applied to drive the rotation of inertial measurement unit (IMU). The motor windings are packaged in printed circuit board (PCB). The system uses the slip-ring to improve power supply reliability. The wireless data transmission and the design of the motor effectively reduce the size and weight of the north finder. A dual-loop proportionalintegral (PI) control algorithm is designed for position and current loop. The vector control and space vector pulse width modulation (SVPWM) techniques are adopted to the current loop. The two-phase axial flux PMSM is tested through back electromotive force and control experiments. And the fourposition north finding system experiments are carried out. In contrast to other north finders, our work confirms the excellent potential of the developed north finding system. It will be an important reference to industrial applications.},

	abstract = {Based on the real-time data of angular velocity and acceleration sensed by IMU, this paper uses the machine learning method, support vector machine (SVM), to find a way to recognize and classify some common action types such as walking, running, going upstairs, going downstairs, jumping, etc. after data preprocessing and dimensionality reduction with Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The algorithm provides a basis for identifying zero speed at different gait states to improve the relevance of the zero-speed correction algorithm. And it will help identify different pedestrian motion states as a basis for motion constraint algorithms.},
